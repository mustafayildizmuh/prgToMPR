# prgToMPR02

This program is designed to convert MasterWood - MasterWork files with the PRG extension to Homag - WoodWop 7.0 files with the MPR extension.

Currently, the conversion works for any holes and millings except for millings that include circular movements. Additionally, pocket operations are not yet supported.
